 ---- ABOUT THIS PROGRAM ----
This program reads in a file, in1.txt, which contains data
for a large undirected graph. Breadth first search is 
performed on the graph to find the shortest path from a 
given source node to a destination node. The results are 
sent to an output file, out1.txt.

 ---- COMPILE & RUN ----
NOTE: I am assuming you are running this program 
in a unix/linux environment.

1. Download the files as a zip file to a directory 
of your choice. Then go to that directory and unzip 
(or 'extract all') the files.

2. In command line, type: 
   gmake
NOTE: If you don't have 'gmake' then you will need to 
reconfigure the 'Makefile' to work with 'make'.

3. Finally, in command line, type:
   FindPath in1.txt [outputfile]
You can name your outputfile anything want but I would 
recommend something other than out1.txt. This will 
allow you to check the results of your outputfile 
with the out1.txt file I supplied.

 ---- ABOUT THESE FILES ----
Graph.c
Contains the Graph ADT to be used by FindPath.c.

Graph.h:
This is the .h file for Graph.c.

GraphTest.c:
This file was used to test the Graph ADT. In order to 
run this program please alter the Makefile to run 
GraphTest.c instead of FindPath.c.

List.h:
This is the .h file for List.c.

List.c:
Contains the List ADT to be used by Graph.c.

ListTest.c:
This file was used to test the List ADT in List.c.
Within this file are some commented lines that can be 
used to activate the RuntimeException from List.c. 
In order to run this program please alter the Makefile 
to run ListTest.c instead of FindPath.c.

FindPath.c:
This is the main file of the program. It reads in in1.txt
which contains data for a large undirected graph. Breadth 
first search is performed on the graph to find the shortest 
path from a given source node to a destination node. The 
results are sent to an output file, out1.txt.

Makefile:
This Makefile is currently set to run the main file, FindPath.c.
This Makefile must be altered to run the GraphTest.c file and
ListTest.c.
