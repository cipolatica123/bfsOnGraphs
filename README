Graph.c
Contains the Graph ADT to be used in various files.
This file contains all the functions required and all
the additional files aswell. 

Graph.h:
This file is what is sent to many of the other files
within this assignment. The functions contained in 
Graph.c and not in Graph.h are considered private.

GraphTest.c:
This file was used to test the Graph ADT.
In order to run this program please type 'gmake GraphTest' 
in command line to run ListTest.c instead of Shuffle.c.

List.h:
This file is what is sent to Graph.c, FindPath.c, ListTest.c,
List.c, Graph.h a,d GraphTest.c. The functions contained in 
List.c and not in List.h are considered private.

List.c:
Contains the List ADT to be used in various files.
This file contains all the functions required and all
the additional files aswell. 

ListTest.c:
This file was used to test the List ADT in List.c.
Within this file are some commented lines that can be 
used to activate the RuntimeException from List.c. 
In order to run this program please type 'gmake ListTest' 
in command line to run ListTest.c instead of Shuffle.c. 

FindPath.c:
This file does everything that was required by the assignment.
This file opens a file to read in data and then it outputs the 
correct information to a different file.

Makefile:
This is the exact Makefile that was given in the assignment.
I am not sure if I needed to alter it at all. In order to run 
this program please type 'gmake ListTest' or 'gmake GraphTest'
in command line to run ListTest.c or GraphTest.c instead of FindPath.c.
